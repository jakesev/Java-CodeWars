Our goal here is to make the base class GameObject Abstract.
Abstract classes exist to be extended. They cannot be instantiated.
Allows a  way to represent an Abstract object.

What is the benefit of abstract class?

The abstract methods is going to exist in this object, not going to provide the 
implementation. Implementation will be applied through the object.

it allows to use abstract method. Why is that neccessary important?
We can use the abstract class name to create objects from other classes.


Cons Type of variable dictates the type of objec

Abtract method are empty and does not do anything when you call it. Literally that is why
it is abstract. However when initiating the method after extending it in the class, you
can implement the method.



INTERFACE assumes all methods are abstract.

An abstract class uses abstract classes and methods that are implemented.


extending means adding onto the methods that already exists.
