Class
Class in C++ are blue-prints representing groups of objects
Main aim for OOP is to bind data and functions that operate on them
so that no other part of code can access except that function.


When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantied(aka object is created)  then the memory is allocated.


THE FOUR BASIC PRINCIPLES OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Encapsulation: Wrapping up data and information under a single unit.
It alsoe leads to data abstraction or hiding.

Abstraction: it is one of the most essential and important features of
OOP in c++. Displaing only essential information and hiding the details.

Polymorphism: Means having many forms. Example A person can have more than
one characteristics, like a man is a father, a husband, an employee. 


Inheritance: Capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics
from another class. Inheritance is one of the most important in OOP

	* Sub class:    a class that inherits properties from another class is 
			        called a subclass or derived class.
	* Super class:  The class whose properties are inherited by a sub class 
					is called a Base class or Super class.
	* Reusability:  Inheritance supports the concept of reusuability.
	
	Example the Animal Class(Super class) are split into 3 sub class
	Dog Class, Cat Class, Cow Class.
	



// at the end of this write a code for all of the OOP methods mentioned!
